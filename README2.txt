Part 2, mostly completed Need some more visulizations to go with the linear regression and show the correlation between variables 
should note that we get extra credit if we use the AI diagram generator mentioned in class

More comments on what I did for part 2 are located in the Jupyter notebook file 


Regression model using multiple variables, high R-squared at 0.6 possible cause of multicollinearity concerns, like grade and condition, possibly that the higher the grade the better the condition, or sqft_living and bathrooms, places with more living space are likely to have more bathrooms, or sqft_lot and waterfront, possible that waterfront lots have more land but not certain because depending on location, lots by the ocean dont have larger lots  Price is our dependent variable and the other used in the linear regression would be our independent variables. -CA

The linear regression equation is as follows I think
#Price = -5.504e+05 + (172.1924 * sqft_living) + (-3e+04 * bathrooms) + (1.012e+05 * grade) + (6.841e+04 * view) + (5.912e+04 * waterfront)

Provide another 2 -3 regressions and some more graphs showing the relationships since I used bathrooms, view, waterfront, and lot as well maybe some graphs on those relationships to price -CA
